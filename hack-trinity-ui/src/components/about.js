                    Do you ever think to yourself 'It is so easy to find past exams for my modules'?
                    No. But that's because you haven't used Trinity Exam Search before. We CS students single handedly
                    improved Blackboard.

                    <br/><br/>
                    Type in your stuff and we find ALL your past exams that are available across Trinity's web presence. 
                    If it's not here, it doesn't exist. We also don't take responsibility for anything bad.
