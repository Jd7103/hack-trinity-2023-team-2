                    Do you ever think to yourself 'It is so easy to find past exams for my modules'?
                    No, because you're a TCD student, and finding past exams as a TCD student is akin to mental torture.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Type in your stuff and we find ALL your past exams that are available across Trinity's web presence. 
                    If it's not here, it doesn't exist. We also don't take responsibility for anything bad. We also got 
                    banned from tcd.ie for a while.
